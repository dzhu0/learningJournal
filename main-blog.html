            <p class="description">After several months of learning in the
                Frontend Developer Career Path, I've made the big jump over
                to the Bootcamp to get expert code reviews of my Solo Projects
                projects and meet like-minded peers.</p>

            <b class="sub-title">How I stay committed to learning</b>
            <p class="description">I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner.
                I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try to create simple
                projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.</p>
            <p class="description">While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful
                to share what I was learning and most things about my journey with the world.</p>
            <b class="sub-title">How I got started</b>
            <p class="description">I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site.
                I would take notes about what I was learning. After each learning session,
                I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write
                short summaries of what I learned using my own words.</p>
            <p class="description">That helped me grok what I was learning,
                and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also
                helping others learn and stay motivated.</p>
